## Bonus - PhantomKit
- Library that makes encrypted json based settings vaults simple to use.
- Also provides simple code functions for various components of PhantomMail that you can break up, tweak, and re-use in your own variants.

## Documentation
- JSON File format (mostly human editable, except encrypted values- tamper evident): https://github.com/FreddieMercurial/PhantomMail/wiki/PhantomKit-Settings-Vault

## Note:
- Includes another copy of crc32 library cloned from [BrightChain](https://github.com/BrightChain/BrightChain) ([Source](https://github.com/BrightChain/BrightChain/blob/main/src/BrightChain.Engine/Helpers/Crc32.cs)), itself derived from stackoverflow and incrementally improved.
